Brief Description

I used css grid for the layout, css animation, event listeners and functions. There was very little challenges that i faced, it went very smoothly the vast majority of the time. But i had some difficulties with the animation and creating the modal and i overcame those difficulties by reviewing the modules on github and doing some online research.
I designed it the way i did because i like the way it looks.
I learned how to add animation and create an image modal.
